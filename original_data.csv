The African Stove Company Ltd. (TASC) is the coordinating/managing entity (CME) of the PoA and is the sole implementer of the VPA. TASC’s mission is financing and developing high-impact climate mitigation projects. 
 
The VPA is an activity that was originally anticipated to be included as a CPA under a CDM PoA (6864: Fuel Efficient Stoves in Africa ) and is now transitioning from the CDM to the Gold Standard under the PoA GS11009: TASC Clean Cooking PoA. The VPA is therefore retroactive in nature, as the first ICS was distributed in Zambia on 26th August 2020. 

The VPA is implemented in communities Zambia where woodfuel is the primary source of energy for cooking and open, 3-stone fires are commonplace. 

The project ICS combust biomass fuels more efficiently, reducing the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and particulate emissions (PM), thus improving the indoor air quality in project households. Due to the higher thermal efficiency of the ICS relative to the 3-stone fires, the ICS reduce the amount of non-renewable biomass fuel required for meeting similar thermal energy needs.

In the absence of the proposed VPA, inefficient 3-stone fires are used for cooking and their replacement with project ICS reduces non-renewable biomass fuel consumption, saving greenhouse gas emissions.

At the time of VPA inclusion, there are 45,000 ICS planned for distribution under the VPA, of which c. 35,000 have been distributed and entered into the monitoring database. It is anticipated that the remaining ICS will be distributed by April 2021.",GOLD_STANDARD_CERTIFIED_PROJECT,Gold Standard for the Global Goals,431949,2020-07-24,2025-07-23,GS TPDDTEC v3.1,Energy Efficiency - Domestic,Large Scale,11145,https://platform.sustain-cert.com/public-project/2379,THE AFRICAN STOVE COMPANY LIMITED,Zambia,ZM,,,,VER,VPA,"[{'name': 'Goal 7: Affordable and Clean Energy', 'issuable_products': []}, {'name': 'Goal 12: Responsible Production and Consumption', 'issuable_products': []}, {'name': 'Goal 13: Climate Action', 'issuable_products': [{'name': 'Verified Emission Reduction', 'abbreviation': 'VER'}, {'name': 'Certified Emission Reduction', 'abbreviation': 'CER'}, {'name': 'Renewable Energy Certificate', 'abbreviation': 'REC'}, {'name': 'Planned Emission Reduction', 'abbreviation': 'PER'}]}, {'name': 'Goal 1: No Poverty', 'issuable_products': [{'name': 'Verified Emission Reduction', 'abbreviation': 'VER'}]}, {'name': 'Goal 5: Gender Equality', 'issuable_products': []}, {'name': 'Goal 3: Good Health and Well-Being', 'issuable_products': [{'name': 'Averted Disability Adjusted Life Year', 'abbreviation': 'ADALY'}]}, {'name': 'Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth', 'issuable_products': []}]",2968.0,11009.0,TASC Clean Cooking PoA,True,True,True,True,True,True,,,True,,275718.0,

Each household will utilize the dung of its cows to feed the digester for the production of biogas for domestic purposes. The generated biogas from the plants to be used for the purpose of cooking and other thermal energy needs in households. The thermal energy generated from the project activity replaces the equal amount of thermal energy which otherwise would have been supplied from the woody biomass (fire-wood) based stove technology. Therefore, the project activity replaces firewood for equal thermal energy needs and thereby reduces harmful greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In addition, the hygienic conditions in the rural areas will be improved by an appropriate disposal of waste. Further, residue from the bio digesters is used as organic fertilizer and will improve soil conditions in rural areas. 

Project Scenario:
The project activity involves bundling of 6,468 household biogas plants located in the state of Punjab, India with varying capacities – 4m3 and 6m3. The project development is performed & maintained by Dhaneshwari Mahila Sewa Sansthan and its supported NGOs. Project activity involves installation of new biogas plant in the households of Punjab and produced biogas will be used in the biogas stoves for thermal energy needs.  Hence, the project activity is a Greenfield project activity.  The size of the bio digesters varies, depending on the number of people and number of cattle available per household.
Residues from the bio digesters are used as organic fertilizer in the garden area and fields of the local people.
Project activity will result in average saving of 33,001 tCO2e/year.

Further, residue from the bio digesters can be used as organic fertilizer and will improve soil fertility in rural areas.
